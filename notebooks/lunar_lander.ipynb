    "\n",
    "1. **Objective**: The main objective is to land the lunar module between two flags safely. Landing outside the flags or crashing the module results in reduced rewards or penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **States**: The state (or observation) space has eight dimensions:\n",
    "   - X and Y coordinates.\n",
    "   - X and Y velocity.\n",
    "   - Angle and angular velocity.\n",
    "   - A boolean (0 or 1) for whether the left leg has made contact.\n",
    "   - A boolean (0 or 1) for whether the right leg has made contact.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Actions**: The agent can take one of four actions at each time step:\n",
    "   - Do nothing.\n",
    "   - Fire the main engine (to slow descent).\n",
    "   - Fire the left orientation engine (to push the lander to the right).\n",
    "   - Fire the right orientation engine (to push the lander to the left).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Rewards**: \n",
    "   - For each frame that the lander is flying, it gets a reward between -0.3 to -0.03 points.\n",
    "   - If the lander crashes (e.g., comes in too fast or lands at a bad angle), it gets a penalty of -100 points.\n",
    "   - If the lander lands successfully and safely, it receives +100 points.\n",
    "   - There are additional points for moving closer to the center and penalties for using fuel (firing engines).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Versions**:\n",
    "   - **LunarLander-v2**: This is the standard version.\n",
    "   - **LunarLanderContinuous-v2**: In this version, instead of discrete actions, the agent has to choose two continuous actions. The first one determines the main engine's thrust (0 not firing, 1 full throttle), and the second one controls orientation (-1 full left, 0 off, 1 full right).\n"
